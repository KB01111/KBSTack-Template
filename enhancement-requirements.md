# Requirements Analysis for KBStack Template Enhancements

## 1. Swagger UI for API Documentation

### Requirements
- Integrate Swagger UI with the existing tRPC API layer
- Provide interactive API documentation for all endpoints
- Ensure type definitions from TypeScript are reflected in Swagger documentation
- Support authentication in the Swagger UI interface
- Allow testing API endpoints directly from the documentation
- Maintain typesafety across the API documentation

### Expected Outcomes
- Developers can view comprehensive API documentation
- API endpoints can be tested without additional tools
- Documentation is automatically generated from code
- Type definitions are consistent between code and documentation
- Swagger UI is accessible through a dedicated route in the application

## 2. Temporal AI Autofix Integration

### Requirements
- Tightly integrate Temporal with AI-powered autofix capabilities
- Automatically detect and fix common code issues
- Provide workflow-based error handling and recovery
- Implement durable execution for long-running processes
- Ensure typesafe workflow definitions
- Support AI-assisted debugging of workflow failures

### Expected Outcomes
- Automatic detection and fixing of code issues
- Reliable execution of business logic with error recovery
- AI-powered suggestions for workflow improvements
- Typesafe workflow definitions with comprehensive error handling
- Integration with existing development tools and CI/CD pipelines

## 3. CopilotKit for UI Testing

### Requirements
- Integrate CopilotKit for AI-assisted UI testing
- Support automated testing of components across all platforms (Web, iOS, Windows)
- Generate test cases based on component definitions
- Provide visual regression testing capabilities
- Enable interactive debugging of UI components
- Support both unit and integration testing of UI elements

### Expected Outcomes
- Automated generation of UI test cases
- Consistent testing across all platforms
- Visual regression detection and reporting
- AI-assisted debugging of UI issues
- Integration with existing testing frameworks
- Improved test coverage and reliability

## Integration Considerations

### Cross-Cutting Concerns
- Ensure all enhancements maintain the typesafe nature of the stack
- Preserve the modular architecture to allow selective use of features
- Maintain consistent developer experience across all platforms
- Ensure performance is not significantly impacted by new features
- Provide clear documentation for all new capabilities

### Technical Constraints
- All integrations must work within the existing monorepo structure
- Dependencies should be managed through the workspace
- Configuration should be centralized and consistent
- New features should not break existing functionality
- Backward compatibility should be maintained where possible

## Success Criteria
- All three enhancements are successfully integrated into the KBStack template
- Documentation is provided for each new feature
- Example code demonstrates the use of each enhancement
- All features work across the supported platforms (Web, iOS, Windows)
- The template remains easy to use and understand
